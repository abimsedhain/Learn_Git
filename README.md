## VERSION CONTROL

Before Git, first we should know about Version Control. The system that tracks/records the changes made to the files or set of files over time so that we can be reverted back to a specific version at a later date is known as ## Version Control ##. Each and every modification is tracked. From addition of a single alphabet to removal of a whole section. There are many version systems but the most popular version control system is # Git #.
